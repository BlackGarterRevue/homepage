          <p>
            Drawn to the shadows between starlight and the breaking sun,
            Seraphina Syren was born with a hunger to create and a fascination
            for the exquisite details others often miss. A wandering enchantress
            who’s lifetime spent in dance & theatre have became the spellwork
            behind this syren's stagecraft, she has woven her art across the
            map, leaving glittering echoes in every city she's called home. Now
            her journeys have led her to the far regions of the mountains of her
            youth where myth still lingers in the woods and a dangerous song
            lures you to the edge of jagged coastline.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2018 Syren conjured Black Garter Revue in Asheville, NC where she
            seduced sold-out crowds from the southern highlands to the foothills
            below. Now based out of Belfast, ME Syren continues to weave her
            magic for packed houses along New England’s foggy coast line. Ever
            drawn to the strange, the sensual, and the sublime, Syren evokes
            worlds where the bizarre is beautiful and the stage becomes a
            portal. With a devotion to unearthing hidden gems and giving voice
            to otherworldly storytellers, Syren invites you into her orbit—where
            mystery reigns and glamour is laced with danger.

          <p>
            Jax Diesel is a high-octane fusion of grit, charm, and raw stage
            presence. A former U.S. Special Operator turned burlesque maverick,
            he brings the discipline of the battlefield to the art of seduction.
            With the swagger of a seasoned cowboy and the precision of a trained
            warrior, Jax captivates audiences with his bold, high-energy
            performances. Whether he's twirling lassos, peeling off layers of
            rugged leather, or smirking beneath a well-worn Stetson, he embodies
            the untamed spirit of the Wild West. Offstage, Jax is a fierce
            advocate for veterans, using his platform to support mental health
            and reintegration programs. Tough as steel yet smooth as whiskey, he
            proves that strength and sensuality make one hell of a combination.

            Rising from her castle's crypt--nestled in the coastal woods of
            Maine--Jenni Darkbloom is here to suck your tips, respectfully.
            Originally from Massachusetts, this transplanted transfemme's
            typical influences include: the shadows of smoky gothic-industrial
            dance clubs, the beauty of a garden springing to life, and cats of
            all sizes. She's a founder of the ✨Big Sparkles Gang✨, and has a
            love of all things ruffled. In 2023, Jenni plunged into the dark
            arts of the burlesque world by becoming an overly prepared kitten.
            Soon after, she added dancing to her repertoire. She hopes you will
            be entranced by this ethereal world as much as she has been
            bewitched by this alluring adventure.

            Every troupe needs someone that can do what ever needs to be done.
            Twylite helps with lightening, sound, stage management, kittening
            you name it he does it. Once the lights go dark he has even more fun
            in the twilight of the night.

          <p>
            Voluptuous Vixen discovered burlesque in 2024 when attending her
            first local showcase and was instantly captivated by the blend of
            theatrical flair, playful sensuality, and uplifting camaraderie
            among performers. Determined to become a part of this supportive
            community, she volunteered as a stage kitten helping to make all the
            on stage & behind-the-scenes magic happen. This role has given Vixen
            invaluable insight into timing, choreography, and the power of
            subtle stagecraft for when she steps onto that stage as kitten or as
            a guest performer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vixen's mission is to inspire others—especially curvy and plus-size
            folks—to embrace their bodies and unleash their inner sparkle
            reminding others that burlesque is more than striptease; it’s an
            empowering art form that champions self-expression, self confidence
            and body positivity.
